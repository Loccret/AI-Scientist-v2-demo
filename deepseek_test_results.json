Therefore, the number of sheep left is the number that survived, which is 9.\n\nSo, after all but 9 die, there are 9 sheep left.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{9}"

Therefore, out of the 17 sheep, 9 survive.\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n- Total sheep initially: 17\n- \"All but 9 die\" implies that 9 sheep do not die.\n- Thus, the number of sheep left is 9.\n\nThis can also be calculated as:\n- Sheep that die: 17 - 9 = 8\n- Sheep left: 17 - 8 = 9\n\nEither way, the result is the same: 9 sheep are left."
